# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
*Incorporates ML Algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Train Test Split and performs Standardized Scaling that is, Normalization on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits and numbers. It then compares the accuracy given by different models.
* Standard Scaling is performed to normalize the dataset to appropriate scale and thereafter,a plot of the graph is obtained on performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
* Dimensionality Reduction is achieved by PCA, to enhance accuracy and analysis.
